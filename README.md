TaxBot is an AI-powered chatbot that helps users summarize important financial tax-related documents and answer questions based on Indian Tax Laws. It also provides insights based on uploaded documents, making tax filing easier and more efficient.

## üöÄ Project Motivation
Filing taxes can be a complex and time-consuming process. TaxBot simplifies tax filing by using AI to:
- Summarize key information from tax documents.
- Answer questions related to Indian tax laws.
- Provide document-based insights using NLP models.
- Ensure complete privacy by running locally on the user's system.

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works
TaxBot leverages state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) models:
- **BART** (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) for document summarization.
- **RoBERTa** (Robustly Optimized BERT Approach) for answering tax-related queries.

The software is packaged as an **executable (.exe) file** using **PyInstaller** so users can run it locally without additional setup.

## üì¶ Features
- **Automatic Document Summarization**: Extract key details from financial tax documents.
- **Tax Law Q&A**: Answer queries based on Indian tax regulations.
- **Privacy-Focused**: Runs locally, ensuring user data remains secure.
- **Standalone Application**: No need for additional software installation.

### üíª Requirements
- Windows OS (Executable is built for Windows)
- No external dependencies required

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **PyTorch**
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)**
- **PyInstaller** (for packaging)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note
The files related to PyInstaller have not been added to the repository. The executable file is hosted separately within the repo.
